GenAI MCP Assessment
Description
Build a prototype of a Customer Support chatbot for customers of a company that sells computer products (monitors, printers, etc).
The company has provided an MCP server using Streamable HTTP for accessing features they’d like to make available:
MCP_SERVER_URL=https://vipfapwm3x.us-east-1.awsapprunner.com/mcp 
Please create a simple prototype and deploy it as a demo. The prototype should use a cheap LLM (flash or mini level). At a minimum, the prototype should have a demo UI and be deployed to a demo cloud like HuggingFace Spaces. Optionally, you could build a full UI and deploy to Vercel, GCP, AWS or Azure.

Video 2: Submit a video describing your activities so far, decisions you've made, and any challenges you've faced. PLEASE ALSO KEEP YOUR VIDEO LOCALLY and remember to share the file with me.
